# AI collaboration summary

**Student name:** [Mrudula Murari]

**Assignment:** Week 2 - Use Agent mode

**Expected time:** About 15 minutes to complete this reflection

## Key interactions

Review your chat history with Agent and document 2 meaningful interactions—ones where you learned something new or had to adjust your prompt.

### Interaction 1: [Setting up npm and fixing scripts]

**My prompt:**

> [Initialize a new npm project and install cowsay.]

**What happened:**

[Agent created the npm project and generated the 'package.json' file. It then installed the cowsay package. I learned how npm initialization generally works and how installing a package works. ]

---

### Interaction 2: [Understanding package.json file]

**My prompt:**

> [/explain What is each field in this file?]

**What happened:**

[Agent explained what each field in package.json does. It helped me understand that npm does not treat it like an automated file.]

---

## Documentation you created

### docs/tutorial-package-json.md

[This document explains all the fields in the package.json files in non-technical jargon. It is explained in beginner-friendly language, and I used it as a reference point to be able to understand how npm uses this file. ]

---

## Reflection

Answer these questions thoughtfully. A few sentences each is fine.

### Agent mode for setup (required)

[How was using Agent for npm setup different from typing commands yourself? What are the advantages? Any downsides?

Using Agent for npm setup was a lot faster than me manually typing out commands, because I did not have to remmeber everything before typing (like syntax.) I liked that Agent walks me through each step. I did accept the changes without fully understanding what they meant, so I had to go bavck to understand what it was doing. ]

### What you learned (required)

[What was the most useful thing you learned in this assignment? This could be about npm, Agent mode, documentation, or anything else.

The most useful thing I learned was how npm scripts work, and how they connect terminal commands to package.json. ]

### Optional questions

Answer any of these that interest you:

- Did you use /explain to understand package.json or terminal output? Was it helpful?
- Did you try asking Agent to write commit messages? How did they compare to your own?
- What npm concepts would you like to learn more about?

[I liked using /explain, because it helped break down technical terms into easy language.]
